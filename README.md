Have there been many occasions where you've glanced over code and not noticed the exclamation
point to the left of a boolean expression?  Does that exclamation point seem to be invisible
at times?  Has life just lost all meaning because you can't find a solution to the exclamation
point problem?

Well despair no more, my friends.  I give you...  

	not(booleanExpression) {
		return ! booleanExpression;
	}

Yes, you can believe your eyes...  not() .

It's the greatest invention since the shake-weight...  not() .
