Have there been many occasions where you've glanced over code and not noticed the
exclamation-point to the left of a boolean expression?  Does that exclamation-point
seem to be invisible at times?  Has life just lost all meaning because you can't
find a solution to the exclamation-point problem and you wish to return to the womb?

Well despair no more, my friends.  I give you...  

	not(booleanExpression) {
		return ! booleanExpression;
	}


It's the greatest invention since the shake-weight...  not() .
